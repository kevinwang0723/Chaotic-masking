# Chaotic-masking
Using the chaos property of Chua's circuit by solving the variable with differential equation, and encrypt the data with chaos noise, which is known as the chaotic masking.

The codes are separted into two parts, the main code (cyr_chaos.m) and the ode solver(chas.m). Remember to download both files in the same directory or folder. 
Operating the main code(cyr_chaos) to demo chaotic masking. 
Sounds are recorded by your microphone and will be encrypt with the chaos data. You can try different parameter in the main code.
