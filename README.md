# Chaotic-masking
Using the chaos property of Chua's circuit by solving the variable by differential equation, and encrypt the data with chaos noise, which is known as the chaotic masking.

The code are separte to two parts, the main code(cyr_chaos.m) and the ode solver(chas.m)
Remember to download both file in the same dierctory or forder.
Operating the main code(cyr_chaos) to demo chaotic masking. Sounds are record by your microphone and will be encrypt with the chaos data.
You can try differnet parameter in the main code.
